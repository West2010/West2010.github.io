Welcome to <site name> where we look back at the decade spanning 2010 - 2019. Ten years of
politics, pop culture, and, eventually, podcasts took us from our awkward pre-teen days to
our *less* awkward "adult" days.

Here we review the media, trends, and just about whatever else we want from the last decade from
the perspective of what it was like to experience them at the time. It's like a memoir, but for 
two pop-culture obsessed losers.

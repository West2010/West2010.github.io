*Daves of Thunder is an oddball comedey podcast hosted by David Feeney and Dave Dameshek that aired its first episode on March 2 2010.*

> Okie Dokie!

2010 was home to many important cultural events: Lost ended, the New Orleans Saints won their first super bowl, and I was told I would have more success in school if I dropped out of pre-algebra. I didn’t. And yet, all of this would eventually fade into the annals of Wikipedia pages and reddit communities, allowing history to leave us with the most important cultural landmark of the year: the unemployment of screenwriter David Feeney and radio personality Dave Dameshek, leading to the subsequent creation of the greatest podcast of all time: Daves of Thunder.   

In 2019, Itunes is overloaded with pairings of nobodies discussing their opinions on sports, TV, politics, or retrospectives of their last ten years. In 2010, the medium was very much extant, but the sheer volume of podcasters was far smaller, allowing advertising through messaging boards and early social media to actually work. If I hadn’t been twelve years old, I would have liked to think I would have jumped on the trend early. Matt and I missed the boat. Adam Carolla, however, had already made a kingdom of this burgeoning audio format, creating the Ace Broadcasting Network: a podcasting platform for those practicing his particular brand of comedy. 

Dameshek, a frequent contributor, was granted a show on the network to host alongside his good friend David Feeney. The podcast began without a title (it was very nearly called “The Dave Dameshek Vanity Project” – a missed opportunity) and didn’t have a particular topic that it was about. At the same time, there was no topic it wasn’t about. The two Daves wouldn’t hold anything back: they’d request listener submitted sex stories, talk about the secret right-wing conspiracy theory leanings of producer Jacuzzi Pete (known for his long nights spent alone, apart from his wife, in his Jacuz), and argue about everything, from Dameshek’s dodging of paying for dinner to Feeney’s interactions with Bette Midler. 

The genius of these discussions though, was the mixed realism of it all. Many of the tales told by the hosts or submitted by the listeners were pre-scripted by Feeney, while just as many of them were authentic. It made for a sort of blurred reality, where the drama of the show was constantly hilarious and intriguing, leaving listeners to guess whether or not what they were hearing was actually taking place or not. At one point, after a particularly cruel roasting of Jacuzzi Pete’s weight (Dameshek and Feeney speculated that he washed himself with rags on sticks), their producer stormed out of the studio, only returning to the show when a family therapist was brought on air to settle their differences. At another, Feeney told the story of the first time he met Dameshek, wherein his cohost apparently asked to be called “The Shek” and vowed to “Cut out the Noise” upon his entrance to Los Angeles. Whether or not the story was true, listeners promptly changed Dameshek’s Wikipedia page to reflect this maybe-truth.

Though Daves never garnered a massive fan base, due in large part to its short run and the limited reach of its creators, in the years past, a cult following has since arisen around the project. The Daves of Thunder subreddit is still remarkably active (home of the BTLS and monkeys – nicknames for fans of the podcast coined by a maybe-fictional drunken rant Dameshek went on in one episode), and references to the incredibly risqué show frequently appeared on The New Girl of all programs – the sitcom that Feeney eventually would come to executive produce. Likewise, Dameshek was hired by the NFL in late 2010, eventually leading to his popular podcast The Dave Dameshek Football Program wherein sparse references to Daves of Thunder sparked new listeners to go back and hear the entire original run of the podcast. 
In mid 2018, thinking similarly to the brains behind Twin Peaks, Murphy Brown, Full House and other storied programs, the two Daves decided to reboot Daves of Thunder. After seven years, the BTLs and Monkeys are once again being given their weekly dose of strange, hilarious, and utterly mysterious humor from the minds of Feeney and Dameshek. Good as it is, potential new listeners would be missing out if they didn’t go back and start from the beginning, going on the weird and wonderful road that is Daves of Thunder. 

Highlights from the Daves include segments such as…

-	Jacuzzi Thoughts: In which producer Jacuzzi Pete, after a long soak and at least a sixer of beer would send his drunken ramblings via email to David Feeney
-	Daddy’s Closet: Listener submitted sex stories, including the tale that would popularize the phrase “Okey Dokey!” in Daves canon – the content of which is not suitable for this website. 
-	Mo Reads Bukowski: In which Dameshek’s mother would come on the show to read the filthiest Bukowski poems ever written. 
-	The Daves of Thunder Players: A scripted segment used for Feeney to pitch new ideas for TV shows and plays, generally plotted around whatever was going on in the show.
-	Audio Blind Date: In which friends of the show would go on a blind date with associate producer “blaster girl” at a generic Italian restaurant.
-	The Jerk List: Where Dameshek would list all those who had wronged him or made him angry from the week before designating the “Creep of the Week” – the crown jewel of the list. 

And much, much… MUCH more.

*In Why We Remember, I look back at a pervading cultural myth and try to understand why anyone even cares anymore.*

Full disclosure: I had to google the exact year of the “Chilean Miners Incident” and time had stolen most of the specifics. For an article meant to reflect on 2010 specifically, this can seem an odd first choice. But I knew I was going to jump the shark eventually, and Max will bring us back to reality with his next article soon. Still, I’m struck by how swiftly and thoroughly thirty-three strangers carved out a lasting pigeonhole in the cultural consciousness. Sorry, what I mean to say is, why the hell do we still remember this story nearly a decade later, despite not being able to name a single miner?
